= Enable access to the Gmail API

To be able to connect to Gmail in an integration, 
you must register your {prodname} environment as a Google client application. 
During registration, you enable the Gmail API and create credentials that
{prodname} uses to access Google APIs that you have enabled.  

If you already created a connection to Google Calendar, then 
{prodname} has the credentials for access to enabled Google
APIs. To be able to create a Gmail connection, you just need to
enable the Gmail API. 

If you already registered your {prodname} environment as a Google client 
application and during registration you enabled the Gmail API, then you do
not need to follow the procedure provided here. You are ready to
create a Gmail connection. 

.Prerequisite
In the *Settings* page in your {prodname} environment, the Google
Calendar entry displays *Edit* and *Remove*, which
indicate that {prodname} has the credentials to access 
enabled Google APIs. If *Register* appears in the Google
Calendar entry and the Gmail entry, then you must 
<<register-with-gmail_{context},register your {prodname} environment as a Google client application>>. 

.Procedure

. In a browser, go to `https://console.developers.google.com`.
. Confirm that you are signed in to the Google account that you used
to register your {prodname} environment as a Google client. If you 
are not, sign in to that account.  
. Ensure that the current Google project is the one you used for
registration. If it is not, change to that project. 
. You should see the *APIs and Services* dashboard. If you do not, then
in the upper left, click 
image:images/Hamburger.png[Navigation menu icon] and select
*APIs and Services* > *Dashboard*. 
. Click the *Gmail API* card.
. In the *Gmail API* page, click *ENABLE*. 
{prodname} copies the Google consumer client ID and client secret
from the {prodname} Google Calendar settings to the {prodname} Gmail settings. 
. In the {prodname} *Settings* page, in the Gmail entry, click *Save*,
and then click *Ok*.
You can now create a Gmail connection.
