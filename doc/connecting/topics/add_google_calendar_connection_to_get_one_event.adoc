= Obtain a particular Google Calendar event

In an integration, you can obtain a particular Google Calendar event.
In the middle of an integration, you might obtain an event that you want to 
update, and then update it in a subsequent Google Calendar connection.
To obtain one event, add a Google Calendar connection to the middle of an integration 
or as the integration's finish connection. 

.Prerequisites
* A Google Calendar connection is available and this connection
is authorized to access the Google calendar that has the 
event that you want to get.

* You are creating or editing an integration and {prodname} is prompting you 
to add a finish connection or select the connection that you want to add
in the middle of an integration. 

.Procedure

. Click a Google Calendar connection that is authorized to access
the calendar that you want to connect to.   
. On the *Choose an Action* page, click *Get a Specific Event*. 
+
This action is useful when you want to update an event. You can obtain the event that
you want to change, and then add another Google Calendar connection that 
updates the event. 

. Specify the name of the calendar that has the event that you want.
. Specify the ID of the event to get. To obtain the event ID, do one of the 
following:
+
* Map it from the previous Google Calendar connection. 
* Manually obtain it from the calendar as follows: 
+
.. In a browser, display the calendar that contains the event you want to get. 
.. Append `?gsessionid=OK&eventdeb=1`to the URL and redisplay the calendar.
.. In the calendar, click the event that you want to get. 
.. In the event popup, click 
image:shared/images/ThreeVerticalDotsKebab.png[Options] and select 
*Troubleshooting info*. 
.. In the popup that Google Calendar displays, copy the string that
follows *`eid=`*. For example, an event ID looks something like this: 
`p1pva2a4t504gbsha12di9ch6k_20181107T150000Z*`.

. Click *Done* to add the connection to the integration. 
The connection appears in the integration flow in the location 
where you added it.
