= Update an event in a Google calendar 

In an integration, you can update an event in a Google calendar
in the middle of the integration or to finish the integration.  
To do this, add a Google Calendar connection to the middle of an integration 
or as the integration's finish connection. 

While it is not a requirement, in practice you probably want to add a
Google Calendar connection that 
link:{LinkFuseOnlineConnectorGuide}#add-google-calendar-connection-to-get-one-event_google-calendar[obtains the event that you want to update]
before you add the Google Calendar connection that updates the event. 
This ensures that you have the values for all of the event's fields. 

.Prerequisites
* A Google Calendar connection is available and this connection
is authorized to access the Google calendar that has the event that
you want to update.
* You are creating or editing an integration and {prodname} is prompting you 
to add a finish connection or select the connection that you want to add
in the middle of an integration. 

.Procedure
. Click a Google Calendar connection that is authorized to access
the calendar that you want to connect to.   
. On the *Choose an Action* page, click *Update Event*. 
. To configure the *Update Event* action: 
+
.. Enter the title of the event that you want to update.
.. Enter content in each event field that you want to update.

. Click *Done* to add the connection to the integration. 
The connection appears in the integration visualization flow in the 
location where you added it. 

. In the integration visualization flow, check for 
image:images/DataTypeMismatchWarning.png[data type mismatch] warnings and
add a data mapper step before each connection that displays this warning.
