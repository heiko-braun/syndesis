In an integration, you can obtain messages from an 
ApacheMQ (AMQ) broker or publish messages to 
an AMQ broker. AMQ uses the OpenWire protocol for communication
between clients and message brokers. To communicate with the following 
broker types, use the AMQ connector to create a connection to the
broker of interest:

* Apache ActiveMQ broker that does not support AMQP
* AMQ 6 broker

To communicate with one of the following broker types,
