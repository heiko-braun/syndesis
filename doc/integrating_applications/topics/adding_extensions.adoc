= Add and manage extensions
:context: add-extension

Extensions let you add customizations to {prodname} so you can integrate 
applications the way you want to. 
After you start using customizations provided in extensions, you can
identify the integrations that use those customizations. This is helpful
to do before you update or delete an extension.
