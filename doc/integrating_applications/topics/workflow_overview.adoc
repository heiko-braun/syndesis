After you log in to the {prodname} console, you can start creating
connections to the applications you want to integrate. For each

Applications that you must register with include: 

* Dropbox
* Gmail
* Google Calendar
* Salesforce
* SAP Concur
* Twitter

With registration in place for those applications, the workflow for
