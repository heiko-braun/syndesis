= About API Provider endpoints

After you publish an integration that starts with an API Provider 
connection, {prodname} provides the external URL for your REST API
service. This is where {prodname} publishes your REST API service. This 
external URL is the base URL for calls to your REST API service endpoints. 
{prodname} displays this URL in the integration's summary page.

Since each operation that the OpenAPI specification defines has its own 
flow, each operation also has its own REST API service endpoint. Each endpoint 
specifies the base URL and optionally specifies the subpath for triggering
execution of a particular integration flow.
