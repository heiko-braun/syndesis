= Develop REST API client connectors
:context: dev-client-connector

{prodname} can create connectors for
Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interfaces
(REST APIs)
that support Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
To do this, {prodname} requires a valid
OpenAPI 2.0 schema that describes a REST API that you want to connect to.
If the API service provider does not make an OpenAPI schema available
then an experienced developer must create the OpenAPI schema.

The following topics provide information and instructions for developing
REST API connectors:
