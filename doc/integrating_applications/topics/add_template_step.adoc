= Add a template step

In an integration, a template step takes data from a source and 
inserts it into the format that is defined in a template that you upload to {prodname}.
The benefit of a template step is that it provides data output in a 
consistent format that you specify. 

In the template, you define placeholders and specify static text. 
When you create the integration, you add a template step, map source fields 
to the template placeholders, and then map template content to the next step 
in the integration. When the integration executes, {prodname}
inserts the values that are in the mapped source fields into an
instance of the template and passes the result to the next step in the integration.

If an integration includes a template step then it is most likely the only 
template step in the integration. However, more than one template step in an 
integration is allowed. 

In this release, {prodname} supports only 
https://mustache.github.io[Mustache] templates. It is expected that 
https://velocity.apache.org[Velocity] and
https://freemarker.apache.org[Freemarker] templates will be supported
in a future release. 

.Prerequisites
* You must be creating or editing an integration. 
* If you are creating an
integration then it must already have its start and finish connections.

.Procedure

. In the integration visualization panel on the left, hover over the
image:images/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[Plus Sign]
at the location where you want to add a template step.
. In the popup, click *Add a Step*.
. On the *Choose a Step* page, click *Template*. The 
*Upload Template* page opens and prompts you to choose how you want to define 
the template. 

. To define the template, do one of the following:
+
* Drag and drop a template file or a file that contains text that you
want to modify to create a template, into the template editor. 
* Click *browse to upload*, navigate to a file, and upload it. 
* In the template editor, start typing to define a template.

+
Note that you might upload a template that is valid in other environments but that 
has errors in {prodname}. {prodname} requires that you append the `body.`
prefix to each placeholder inside double curly braces. 
For example, while `{{text}}` is valid in a typical template, you must 
specify `{{body.text}}` in a template that you use with {prodname}. 
Here is an example of a valid template:

+
----
At {{body.time}}, {{body.name}} tweeted:
{{body.text}}
----

. In the template editor, ensure that the template
is valid for use with {prodname}. {prodname} displays 
image:images/RedCircleXError.png[a red error indicator] to the left of
a line that contains a syntax error. Hovering over a red indicator displays hints
about how to resolve the error. 
+
Inside each set of double curly braces, the `body.` prefix is required. 
Data mapping does not work if the `body.` prefix is missing. 
For example, if you upload a template that does not have the `body.` prefix 
on each placeholder, {prodname} displays an error icon on those lines.

. Click *Done* to add the template step to the integration.
+ 
If the *Done* button is not enabled then there is at least one syntax error 
that you must correct. 
+
Input to a template step must be in the form of a JSON object. Consequently, 
you must add
a data mapping step before a template step. 
. To add a data mapper step before the template step:
.. In the left panel, hover over the  
image:images/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[Plus Sign] that is 
immediately before the template step that you just added and then click *Add a Step*. 
.. On the *Choose a Step* page, click *Data Mapper*.
.. In the data mapper, map a source field to each template placeholder field. 
+
For example, using the template above, map a source field 
to each of these template fields:
+
* `body.time`
* `body.name`
* `body.text`
.. In the upper right, click *Done* to add the data mapper step to the 
integration.

+
Output from a template step is always a JSON object. Consequently, you must
add a data mapper step after a template step.
. To add a data mapper step after the template step:
.. In the left panel, hover over the  
image:images/PlusSignToAddStepOrConnection.png[Plus Sign] that is 
immediately after the template step you just added and then click *Add a Step*. 
.. On the *Choose a Step* page, click *Data Mapper*.
.. In the data mapper, map the template's *message* field, which 
always contains the result of inserting source fields into the
template, to a target field. For example, suppose that a Gmail connection is 
next in the integration and you want to send the result of the template step
as the content of a Gmail message. To do this, you would map the *message* 
source field to the *text* target field.
.. In the upper right, click *Done*.
