= Trigger integration execution with an API call

:context: api-provider

To trigger execution of an integration on demand, start the integration
with a connection to a REST API service that you provide. {prodname} refers
to these kinds of connections as API Provider connections. API Provider 
connections allow a REST API client to invoke a command that triggers 
integration execution. The following topics provide information and 
instructions for creating integrations that start with API Provider 
connections.
